You can if you think you can
Grow through what you go through
Take the risk or lose the chance
At the end of hardship comes happiness
You can do anything you set your mind to
Every day is a second chance
Happiness looks gorgeous on you
Nothing is worth more than this day
Throw kindness around like confetti
I am not young enough to know everything
The eyes are useless when the mind is blind
You have to be odd to be number one
Life is largely a matter of expectation
Anything worth doing is worth doing slowly
Life is accepting what is and working from that
